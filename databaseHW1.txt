Part 1
4.7. Consider the LIBRARY relational database schema shown in the text in Figure 4.6. Choose the appropriate action (reject, cascade, set to NULL , set to default) for each referential integrity constraint (that is, foreign key constraint), for the DELETION of a referenced tuple (don't worry about the UPDATE; those are all "cascade"). Justify your choices.
Answers:
#1 Cascade - The Publisher table is not referenced by another table with the database.
#2 Reject - it would break the referential integrity by deleting a record that contains a value referred to by foreign key in another table
#3 Reject - it would break the referential integrity by deleting a record that contains a value referred to by foreign key in another table
#4 Reject - it would break the referential integrity by deleting a record that contains a value referred to by foreign key in another table
#5 Reject - it would break the referential integrity by deleting a record that contains a value referred to by foreign key in another table
#6 Reject - it would break the referential integrity by deleting a record that contains a value referred to by foreign key in another table
#7 Cascade - The borrower table is not referenced by another table in the database

Part 2
4.10. Specify the following queries in SQL on the COMPANY relational database schema shown in Figure 3.5. Show the result of each query if it is applied to the COMPANY database in Figure 3.6.
Answers:
#1 
SELECT e.lname, e.fname, p.pname
FROM department d, employee e, works_on w, project p
WHERE d.dnumber = 5
AND e.ssn = w.essn
AND w.pno = p.pnumber
AND p.pname = 'ProductX'
AND w.hours >=10
ORDER BY e.lname, e.fname

#2
SELECT e.fname, e.lname
FROM employee e, dependent d
WHERE e.ssn = d.essn
AND e.fname = d.dependent_name

#3 
SELECT e.fname, e.lname
FROM employee e, department d
WHERE d.dnumber = 5
AND e.super_ssn = d.mgr_ssn
ORDER BY e.lname, e.fname


Part 3
4.12. Specify the following queries in SQL on the database schema of Figure 1.2.
Answers:
 #1

SELECT s.name
FROM student s
WHERE s.major = 'CS'
AND s.class = '4'

#2
SELECT s.instructor, c.course_name
FROM section s, course c
WHERE s.instructor = 'King'
AND s.course_number = c.course_number

#3
SELECT s.instructor, c.course_name, s.course_number, s.year, s.semester
FROM section s, course c
WHERE s.instructor = 'King'
AND s.course_number = c.course_number

#4
SELECT s.name, c.course_name, c.course_number, c.credit_hours, s1.semester, s1.year, g.grade
FROM student s, course c, section s1, grade_report g
WHERE s.major = 'CS'
AND s.class = '4'
AND s1.course_number = c.course_number
AND g.section_identifier = s1.section_identifier
AND g.student_number = s.student_number
