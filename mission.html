          <h3>Who We Are</h3>
          <p>St. Mary of the Lake Parish - located on Chicago's North Side in the Buena Park/Uptown neighborhood - is an evolving spiritual and social community blessed by a diversity that is unsurpassed in our city.

          Founded in 1901, St. Mary of the Lake Parish provides spiritual nourishment, guidance and comfort for the faithful of our own and adjoining neighborhoods and a Catholic education for our children in our own preschool and grade school.

          Wherever you hail from, you are welcome to join us and make St. Mary of the Lake Parish your spiritual home.</p>



            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                  The Roman Catholic Parish of St. Mary of the Lake Church, by the grace of God, provides for the spiritual and human needs of the parish family and community; fosters unity and camaraderie by incorporating the rich diversity of cultures; and develops social, educational, ecumenical and interfaith outreach programs for living and proclaiming the Gospel message. St. Mary of the Lake is grounded in the present and faces the future with Faith, Hope and Love.</p>


            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      
            <p>Total commitment in furthering the word of Jesus Christ through evangelization and the sharing of our material gifts by being accountable, responsible and grateful stewards of God's earthly possessions.</p>

            <h3>Our Statement</h3>   
  
            <p>We believe that all things come from God. He is the Source, who generously allows us to use and hold in trust these material possessions we accumulate in time. We also believe that we should use and share these gifts responsibly, with justice and love with others. In joyous gratitude, we are returning a portion of Christ's gifts of time, talent and treasure. Our Parish is a Christ-centered, prayerful, hospitable, caring and vibrant community.</p>

<h3> Our Prayer</h3>
<blockquote> <p>"Riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might; and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all. And now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your glorious name.

But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to make this freewill offering? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are aliens and transients before you, as were all our ancestors; our days on the earth are like shadow, and there is no hope. 

O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. I know, my God, that you search the heart, and take pleasure In uprightness; in the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you. 

O Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you."</p> <footer>(1 Chronicles 29:12-18)</footer></blockquote>

Amen.
